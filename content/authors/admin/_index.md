I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics at Tilburg University affiliated with TILEC. I expect to graduate in the summer of 2022. [](https://rgreminger.github.io/files/jmp.pdf)

My main research interests are in the areas of empirical industrial organization and economics of innovation. In my research, I use structural models to study the interplay between technology standards, essential patents, and industry structure, and how this interaction can stimulate technology progress.

My supervisors are Tobias Klein, Florian Schutt, and Christoph Walsh. 

I will be available for interviews at the EAA conference. My job market paper is available {{< staticref "uploads/demo_resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
