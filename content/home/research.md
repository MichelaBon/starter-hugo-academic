**Standardization and Patent Portfolio: Understanding Firms' Choices in Standard Project**

This paper studies the relationship between joining a standardization project and the firms' patent portfolio choices. Firms declare patents as essential to multiple standards issued by several organizations, and technology standards in the ICT sector share multiple technology classes. Focusing on a set of firms who declare to own essential patents to several standards issued by different organizations, I study how firms decide in which standards to invest and how they construct their patent portfolio in relation to the rules endorsed by Standard Development Organizations.
