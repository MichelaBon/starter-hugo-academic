I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I am also affiliated with ESSEC Business School, working on topics within the BlaBlaModes project. 

My main research interests are in Empirical Industrial Organization and Market Design, focusing on the digital economy,  transportation, and standardization.  In my work, I combine economic models of strategic interactions, market data, and econometric tools for structural estimation and causal inference.
