# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "*Job Market Paper*, 2021 Compatibility is recognized to be a socially desirable outcome but the welfare implications from a single standard are still ambiguous. This paper studies the effect of a single technology standard in the U.S. wireless telecommunications market from 2015 to 2018. I develop and estimate a structural model of consumer choice of wireless carriers and coverage investment to quantify the impact of a compatible network on market outcomes and welfare. Using counterfactual simulations, I find that compatibility is the welfare superior policy, regardless of the technology chosen. While the overall producer surplus is higher when moving to uniform wireless networks, whether consumers are better-off depends on the technology standard chosen. Under a GSM regime, consumer surplus decreases by $1.7 billion, coverage decreases by 20.01%, and prices increase for two wireless carriers. Under a CDMA compatible network, consumer surplus increases by $2.2 billion, coverage decreases by 9.78%, and prices fall for all four major carriers. "
