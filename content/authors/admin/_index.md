I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics at Tilburg University and affiliated with the Tilburg Law and Economics Center (TILEC). My main research interests are in the areas of empirical industrial organization and the economics of innovation. In my research, I use structural models to study the interplay between technology standards, patents, and industry structure, and how this interaction can stimulate technological progress.

My supervisors are Florian Schuett, Christoph Walsh, and Tobias Klein. My job market paper is available {{< staticref "files/jmp.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
