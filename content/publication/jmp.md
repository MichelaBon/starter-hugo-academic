# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract="Compatibility is recognized to be a socially desirable outcome but the welfare implications from a single standard are still ambiguous. This paper studies the effect of unifying two incompatible standards for wireless networks in the U.S. wireless telecommunications market from 2015 to 2018. I develop and estimate a structural model of consumer choices of wireless carriers and 3G coverage investment to quantify the impact of a compatible network. Using counterfactual experiments, I find that compatibility is the welfare superior policy, regardless of the technology chosen. While the overall producer surplus is higher when moving to uniform wireless networks, whether consumers are better-off depends on the technology standard chosen. Under a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) regime, consumer surplus decreases by $1.7 billion, coverage decreases by 20.01%, and prices increase for two wireless carriers. Under a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) compatible network, consumer surplus increases by $2.2 billion, coverage decreases by 9.78%, and prices fall for all four major carriers."
