I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at ESSEC Business School, working on topics within the BlaBlaModes project. 

My main research interests include Empirical Industrial Organization and Applied Microeconomics. With my current projects, I examines how compatibility and competition in network markets can improve social welfare, with a focus on Information and Communications Technology and Transportation industries. In my work, I combine economic models of strategic interactions, market data, and econometric tools for structural estimation and causal inference.
