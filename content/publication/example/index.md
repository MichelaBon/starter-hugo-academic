abstract: Compatibility is recognized to be a socially desirable outcome but the
  welfare implications from mandating compatibility are still ambiguous. This
  paper studies the effect of mandating compatibility in the U.S. wireless
  telecommunications market from 2015 to 2018. I develop and estimate a
  structural model of consumer choice of wireless carriers and coverage
  investment to quantify the impact of a mandated standard policy on market
  outcomes and welfare. Using counterfactual simulations, I find that mandating
  compatibility is the welfare superior policy, regardless of the technology
  chosen. While firms benefit from moving to uniform wireless networks, whether
  consumers are better-off depends on the technology standard mandated by the
  government. Under a GSM regime, consumer surplus decreases by \$1.7 billion,
  coverage decreases by 20.01\%, and prices increase for two wireless carriers.
  Under a CDMA compatibility policy, consumer surplus increases by \$2.2
  billion, coverage decrease by 9.78\%, and prices fall for all four major
  carriers.
